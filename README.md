Crowdfunding Smart Contract
Overview
The Crowdfunding smart contract is a Solidity-based contract that allows users to contribute funds towards a specific goal set by the contract owner. The contract provides the following key features:

Goal and Deadline: The contract owner can set a fundraising goal and a deadline for the crowdfunding campaign.
Contribution: Users can contribute funds to the campaign by calling the contribute() function.
Goal Checking: The contract owner can check if the fundraising goal has been reached by calling the checkGoalReached() function.
Fund Withdrawal: If the fundraising goal is reached, the contract owner can withdraw the funds by calling the withdrawFunds() function.
Refund: If the fundraising goal is not reached by the deadline, users can request a refund of their contributions by calling the refund() function.

Contract Structure

owner: The address of the contract owner who can withdraw the funds if the goal is reached.
goal: The fundraising goal set by the contract owner.
deadline: The deadline for the crowdfunding campaign, set by the contract owner.
contributions: A mapping that stores the contribution amount of each user.
goalReached: A flag indicating whether the fundraising goal has been reached.
fundsWithdrawn: A flag indicating whether the funds have been withdrawn by the contract owner.
contribute(): Allows users to contribute funds to the campaign.
checkGoalReached(): Checks if the fundraising goal has been reached.
withdrawFunds(): Allows the contract owner to withdraw the funds if the goal is reached.
refund(): Allows users to request a refund of their contributions if the goal is not reached.

Usage

Deploy the Crowdfunding contract to the Ethereum network, passing the fundraising goal and the campaign duration as constructor parameters.
Users can call the contribute() function to send their contributions to the contract.
After the campaign deadline, the contract owner can call the checkGoalReached() function to check if the goal has been reached.
If the goal is reached, the contract owner can call the withdrawFunds() function to withdraw the funds.
If the goal is not reached, users can call the refund() function to request a refund of their contributions.

Security Considerations

Access Control: The contract owner has the ability to withdraw the funds if the goal is reached. Ensure that the contract owner's address is secure and not susceptible to unauthorized access.
Timestamp Dependency: The contract relies on the block.timestamp variable to determine the campaign deadline. Be aware of potential timestamp manipulation attacks.
Reentrancy Attacks: The contract does not currently implement any explicit reentrancy protection. Consider using the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern or the OpenZeppelin ReentrancyGuard modifier to mitigate reentrancy vulnerabilities.
Overflow/Underflow Checks: The contract does not currently implement explicit overflow/underflow checks. Consider using a library like OpenZeppelin's SafeMath to prevent arithmetic-related vulnerabilities.
